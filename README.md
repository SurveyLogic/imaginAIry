<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

##  üßê What is it?
Director provides a advance AI first framework for developing intelligent agents that can interact with your audio/video collection in natural language. Whether you're dealing with  social content, lectures, movies, youtube videos, TV shows, talks, music, or other digital content, Director offers variety of tools to build powerful AI-powered assistants.

It uses the VideoDB‚Äôs scalable "video as data" infrastructure to create agentic workflows. For example, in natural language you can give commands like `‚Äúupload this video and send the bullet point summary on my slack‚Äù` and the agent will handle the rest.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Node.js 22.8.0 or higher
- npm

### Installation

**1. Clone the repository:**

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/video-db/Director.git
cd Director
```

**2. Run the setup script:**

```bash
./setup.sh
```

> This script will:
> - Install nvm (Node Version Manager) if not already installed
> - Install Node.js 22.8.0 using nvm
> - Install Python and pip
> - Set up virtual environments and install dependencies for frontend and backend

Supported platforms: Mac ‚úî Linux ‚úî 

**3. Configure the environment variables:**
Edit the `.env` files to add your API keys and other configuration options.



## üí¨ Running the Application

To start both the backend and frontend servers:

```bash
make run
```

This will start the backend server on `http://127.0.0.1:8000` and the frontend server on `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

To run only the backend server: `make run-be`
To just run the frontend development server: `make run-fe`

## üìñ Documentation

The project documentation is built using MkDocs. To serve the documentation locally on port 9000:

Activate the environment and install dependencies for development:

```bash
source backend/venv/bin/activate  
make install-be
```

```bash
mkdocs serve -a localhost:9000
```

To build the documentation:

```bash
mkdocs build
```

## üìò Creating a New Agent
To create a new agent in Director, follow these steps:

1. **Copy the template**: Duplicate `sample_agent.py` in `Director/backend/director/agents/` and rename it to your agent's name.

2. **Update class details**:
   - Rename the class (e.g., from `SampleAgent` to `YourAgentName`)
   - Update `agent_name` and `description`

3. **Modify the `__call__` method**:
   - Update parameters and docstring
   - Implement your agent's logic

4. **Handle output and status updates**:
   - Use appropriate content types (TextContent, VideoContent, ImageContent, SearchResultContent)
   - Update `self.output_message.actions` for progress indicators
   - Use `push_update()` to emit progress events
   - Set content status (progress, success, error) and messages

5. **Implement error handling**:
   - Set error status and messages if issues occur

6. **Finalize the response**:
   - Call `self.output_message.publish()` to emit final state and persist session
   - Return an `AgentResponse` with result, message, and data

7. **Register the agent**:
   - Import your new agent class in `Director/backend/director/handler.py`
   - Add it to the `self.agents` list in `ChatHandler`
![director_reasoning_engine](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13a92f0d-5b66-4a95-a2d4-0b73aa359ca6)
Remember to consider creating reusable tools if your agent's functionality could be shared across multiple agents.
