<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

##  üßê What is it?
Director provides a flexible framework for developing intelligent media agents that can interact with your audio/video collection in natural language. Whether you're dealing with lectures, movies, social content, youtube videos, TV shows, talks, music, or other digital content, Director offers tools to build powerful AI-powered assistants.

It uses the VideoDB‚Äôs powerful infrastructure to create agentic workflows. For example in natural language you can give commands like `‚Äúupload this video and send the bullet point summary on my slack‚Äù` and the agent will handle the rest.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Key Features
- **ü§ñ AI Agent Framework:** Build custom agents to perform tasks like summarization, search, indexing, clipping and library organization. 
- **üé® Innovative User Experience:** Complete framework with open source chat based UI, Video player and interactions that can help you create the experience you need. 
- **üîç Media Analysis:** Your video infra is taken care by [VideoDB](https://videodb.io). Connect with popular LLMs, Databases, and GenAI APIs seamlessly.
- **üß© Extensible Architecture:** Easily add new capabilities through tools and modules. Run locally or deploy on your own cloud. 


## üèÉ Getting Started
üì∫ [Watch: Setup video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Node.js 22.8.0 or higher
- npm

### Installation

**1. Clone the repository:**

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/video-db/Director.git
cd Director
```

**2. Run the setup script:**

```bash
./setup.sh
```

> This script will:
> - Install nvm (Node Version Manager) if not already installed
> - Install Node.js 22.8.0 using nvm
> - Install Python and pip
> - Set up virtual environments and install dependencies for frontend and backend

Supported platforms: Mac ‚úî Linux ‚úî 

**3. Configure the environment variables:**
Edit the `.env` files to add your API keys and other configuration options.



## üí¨ Running the Application

To start both the backend and frontend servers:

```bash
make run
```

This will start the backend server on `http://127.0.0.1:8000` and the frontend server on `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

To run only the backend server: `make run-be`
To just run the frontend development server: `make run-fe`

## üìñ Documentation

The project documentation is built using MkDocs. To serve the documentation locally on port 9000:

Install dependencies for development:

```bash
make install-be
```

```bash
mkdocs serve -a localhost:9000
```

To build the documentation:

```bash
mkdocs build
```

## üìò Creating a New Agent
üì∫ Watch: Code walkthrough

To create a new agent in Director, follow these steps:

1. **Copy the template**: Duplicate `sample_agent.py` in `Director/backend/director/agents/` and rename it to your agent's name.

2. **Update class details**:
   - Rename the class (e.g., from `SampleAgent` to `YourAgentName`)
   - Update `agent_name` and `description`

3. **Modify the `__call__` method**:
   - Update parameters and docstring
   - Implement your agent's logic

4. **Handle output and status updates**:
   - Use appropriate content types (TextContent, VideoContent, ImageContent, SearchResultContent)
   - Update `self.output_message.actions` for progress indicators
   - Use `push_update()` to emit progress events
   - Set content status (progress, success, error) and messages

5. **Implement error handling**:
   - Set error status and messages if issues occur

6. **Finalize the response**:
   - Call `self.output_message.publish()` to emit final state and persist session
   - Return an `AgentResponse` with result, message, and data

7. **Register the agent**:
   - Import your new agent class in `Director/backend/director/handler.py`
   - Add it to the `self.agents` list in `ChatHandler`

Remember to consider creating reusable tools if your agent's functionality could be shared across multiple agents.
