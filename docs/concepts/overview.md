# Reasoning Engine

The Reasoning Engine is the core of the system. It is responsible for processing the input data and generating the output data. The Reasoning Engine is a collection of modules that work together to perform the reasoning process. Each module is responsible for a specific task, such as data processing, rule evaluation, or output generation.


# Agents

Agents are the core building blocks of the Reasoning Engine. They are responsible for processing the input data and generating the output data. Agents are designed to be modular and extensible, allowing developers to easily add new functionality to the system. Each agent is responsible for a specific task, such as data processing, rule evaluation, or output generation.

# Tools

Tools are the core building blocks of the Agents. They are used to extend the capabilities of the agents. Tools are designed to be modular and extensible, allowing developers to easily add new functionality to the system. Each tool is responsible for a specific task, such as data processing, rule evaluation, or output generation.
