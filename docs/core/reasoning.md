## Reasoning

The "Reasoning" component of the Video Agent system comprises the ReasoningEngine and its configuration model, ReasoningEngineConfig. These core elements are designed to analyze and process input messages by utilizing a configurable set of language models. This facilitates advanced decision-making and response generation tailored to the context of video sessions. The configuration model allows precise control over operational parameters such as the number of iterations, system prompts, and integration with Langfuse for detailed operational tracing, enabling the system to adapt effectively to various interaction scenarios.
